## Task Status Legend

- ⬜️ TODO - Not started
- 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Currently working on
- ✅ DONE - Completed and tested
- ⚠️ BLOCKED - Cannot proceed (waiting on prerequisite)
- ❌ FAILED - Attempted but failed (needs retry)

## Risk Levels

- 🟢 **LOW** - Simple extraction, minimal dependencies
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Moderate complexity, some dependencies
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Complex logic, many dependencies, needs careful testing

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1.1** (Extract Colors) - Lowest risk, builds confidence
2. **Complete Phase 1** before moving to Phase 2
3. **Run full test suite** after each phase
4. **Create PR** after each phase for review
5. **Document lessons learned** after each high-risk task

## Lessons Learned

### Task 1.1 - Extract Colors (2025-09-30)
- ✅ Task was straightforward and low-risk as predicted
- ✅ Creating feature branch BEFORE starting is better practice
- ✅ Verification script caught formatting issues immediately
- ✅ Wildcard import (`use crate::ui::teletext::colors::*;`) worked well
- ✅ All 40 tests continued passing
- ⏱️ Actual time: ~12 minutes (estimated: 10m) - very close!
- 📝 Remember to run `cargo fmt` before final commit

### Task 1.2 - Extract Team Abbreviations (2025-09-30)
- ✅ Function moved cleanly with all documentation
- ✅ Public API maintained via re-export in lib.rs

## Emergency Rollback

If something breaks badly:

```bash
# Reset to main branch
git checkout main

# Delete all refactor branches
git branch | grep refactor/ | xargs git branch -D

# Start fresh
git checkout -b refactor/restart
```
