- ‚úÖ Extracted both GameResultData struct and ScoreType enum together
- ‚úÖ ScoreType is tightly coupled with GameResultData, so combined makes sense

- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ All 40 tests still passing
- ‚è±Ô∏è Actual time: ~8 minutes - very quick!
- üìù Adapted task list to reality - focusing on extractable components first

### Phase 1 Completion Note (2025-09-30)

**Tasks 1.1-1.7: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ  
**Tasks 1.8-1.12: DEFERRED to Phase 2** ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Rationale:**
- Tasks 1.1-1.7 successfully extracted all **standalone data structures** from teletext_ui.rs
- Tasks 1.8-1.12 involve extracting **methods from the large TeletextPage impl block**
- These require a different refactoring strategy:
  - Can't simply move methods to new files (they're tightly coupled to TeletextPage struct)
  - Need to either:
    1. Create trait implementations for groups of methods
    2. Use the newtype pattern to wrap TeletextPage
    3. Further split TeletextPage into smaller structs
- This is better suited for Phase 2 after we've completed similar work on other large impl blocks

**Phase 1 Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Extracted 8 standalone modules (439 lines)
- ‚úÖ teletext_ui.rs reduced by 9.4% (4,675 ‚Üí 4,236 lines)
- ‚úÖ Created clean module structure under src/ui/
- ‚úÖ All tests passing, zero breakage
- ‚úÖ Perfect backward compatibility

**Next Phase Strategy:**
Phase 2 will focus on modularizing data_fetcher/api.rs (4,537 lines) which also has similar challenges.
We'll develop patterns there that we can apply back to teletext_ui.rs.

### Task 1.8+ - [Deferred to Phase 2]
- See Phase 1 completion note above

### Task 2.1 - Extract URL Builders (2025-09-30)
- ‚úÖ Created src/data_fetcher/api/ subdirectory structure
- ‚úÖ Extracted 5 URL builder functions to api/urls.rs (108 lines)
- ‚úÖ Moved main API implementation to api/core.rs
- ‚úÖ Converted data_fetcher.rs to data_fetcher/mod.rs
- ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility via re-exports
- ‚úÖ All 40 tests still passing
- ‚è±Ô∏è Actual time: ~12 minutes (estimated: 15m) - efficient!
- üìù Core API reduced: 4,537 ‚Üí 4,435 lines (102 lines extracted)
- üìù Clean module structure established for future extractions

### Task 2.2 - Extract HTTP Client (2025-09-30)
- ‚úÖ Extracted 2 HTTP client creation functions to api/http_client.rs (29 lines)
- ‚úÖ Separated connection pooling and timeout configuration logic
- ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility via re-exports
- ‚úÖ All 40 tests still passing
- ‚è±Ô∏è Actual time: ~8 minutes (estimated: 15m) - very fast!
- üìù Core API reduced: 4,435 ‚Üí 4,413 lines (22 lines extracted)
- üìù Small but focused module for HTTP client configuration

### Task 2.3 - Extract Date Logic (2025-09-30)
- ‚úÖ Extracted 3 date/season functions and 4 constants to api/date_logic.rs (85 lines)
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate date determination logic from core.rs
- ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility via re-exports
- ‚úÖ Conditional import for test function (determine_fetch_date_with_time)
- ‚úÖ All 40 tests still passing
- ‚è±Ô∏è Actual time: ~15 minutes (estimated: 25m) - faster than expected!
- üìù Core API reduced: 4,413 ‚Üí 4,339 lines (74 lines extracted)
- üìù Cleaner separation of date/season logic from API logic

**Phase 2 Progress So Far:**
- ‚úÖ 3 tasks completed (2.1-2.3)
- ‚úÖ Core API reduced by 4.4% (4,537 ‚Üí 4,339 lines, 198 lines extracted)
- ‚úÖ 3 new focused modules created
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with zero breakage
- ‚úÖ Clean module structure for continued refactoring

## Emergency Rollback

If something breaks badly:

```bash
# Reset to main branch
git checkout main

# Delete all refactor branches
git branch | grep refactor/ | xargs git branch -D

# Start fresh
git checkout -b refactor/restart
```
