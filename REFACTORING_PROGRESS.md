### Phase 1 Completion Note (2025-09-30)

**Tasks 1.1-1.7: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ  
**Tasks 1.8-1.12: DEFERRED to Phase 2** ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Rationale:**
- Tasks 1.1-1.7 successfully extracted all **standalone data structures** from teletext_ui.rs
- Tasks 1.8-1.12 involve extracting **methods from the large TeletextPage impl block**
- These require a different refactoring strategy:
  - Can't simply move methods to new files (they're tightly coupled to TeletextPage struct)
  - Need to either:
    1. Create trait implementations for groups of methods
    2. Use the newtype pattern to wrap TeletextPage
    3. Further split TeletextPage into smaller structs
- This is better suited for Phase 2 after we've completed similar work on other large impl blocks

**Phase 1 Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Extracted 8 standalone modules (439 lines)
- ‚úÖ teletext_ui.rs reduced by 9.4% (4,675 ‚Üí 4,236 lines)
- ‚úÖ Created clean module structure under src/ui/
- ‚úÖ All tests passing, zero breakage
- ‚úÖ Perfect backward compatibility

**Next Phase Strategy:**
Phase 2 will focus on modularizing data_fetcher/api.rs (4,537 lines) which also has similar challenges.
We'll develop patterns there that we can apply back to teletext_ui.rs.
