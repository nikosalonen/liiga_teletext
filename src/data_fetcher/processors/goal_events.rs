/// Processes goal events for both teams in a game with team-scoped disambiguation.
/// This enhanced version applies disambiguation separately for home and away teams,
/// ensuring that players with the same last name on the same team are distinguished
/// with first initials (e.g., "Koivu M.", "Koivu S.").
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `game` - A type implementing HasTeams trait containing both home and away team data
/// * `home_players` - A slice of tuples containing (player_id, first_name, last_name) for home team
/// * `away_players` - A slice of tuples containing (player_id, first_name, last_name) for away team
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Vec<GoalEventData>` - A vector of processed goal events in chronological order with disambiguated names
///
/// # Features
/// - Applies team-scoped disambiguation (players on different teams don't affect each other)
/// - Formats player names with first initials when needed (e.g., "Koivu M.", "Koivu S.")
/// - Includes goal timing and score information
/// - Marks special goal types (powerplay, empty net, etc.)
/// - Preserves video clip links when available
/// - Maintains chronological order of goals from both teams
///
/// # Example
/// This function is typically used with game data from the API to create
/// disambiguated goal events that avoid confusion between players with similar names.
/// When multiple players share the same last name on a team, their names are
/// differentiated using first initials (e.g., "Koivu M." vs "Koivu S.").
