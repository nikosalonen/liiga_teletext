/// Processes goal events for both teams in a game, converting them into a standardized format
/// with player names and additional metadata.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `game` - A type implementing HasTeams trait containing both home and away team data
/// * `player_names` - HashMap mapping player IDs to their formatted names (e.g., "Koivu" instead of "Mikko Koivu")
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Vec<GoalEventData>` - A vector of processed goal events in chronological order
///
/// # Features
/// - Formats player names consistently (e.g., "Koivu" instead of "Mikko Koivu")
/// - Includes goal timing and score information
/// - Marks special goal types (powerplay, empty net, etc.)
/// - Preserves video clip links when available
/// - Maintains chronological order of goals from both teams
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
