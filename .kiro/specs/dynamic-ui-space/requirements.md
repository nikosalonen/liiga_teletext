# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing teletext-style UI to dynamically utilize available terminal space more effectively. The current UI has a fixed layout that doesn't adapt well to different terminal sizes or when more space is available. The goal is to make the UI responsive to terminal dimensions while preserving the authentic teletext aesthetic and existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a large terminal window, I want the UI to utilize the available space more effectively, so that I can see more information without scrolling or pagination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal width is greater than the minimum required width THEN the system SHALL expand content horizontally to utilize available space
2. WHEN the terminal height is greater than the minimum required height THEN the system SHALL display more content vertically without pagination
3. WHEN terminal dimensions change during runtime THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the layout to fit the new dimensions
4. WHEN content exceeds available space THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing pagination behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with varying terminal sizes, I want the UI layout to remain consistent and readable, so that the teletext aesthetic is preserved regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI adapts to different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the teletext color scheme and styling
2. WHEN content is expanded THEN the system SHALL preserve the relative positioning of UI elements (header, subheader, content, footer)
3. WHEN using minimum terminal dimensions THEN the system SHALL display content exactly as it currently does
4. WHEN terminal is too small THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the constraint without breaking the layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing game information, I want to see more detailed information when space allows, so that I can get a richer experience on larger screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN horizontal space is available THEN the system SHALL display additional game details (longer team names, more precise timestamps, extended goal information)
2. WHEN vertical space is available THEN the system SHALL show more games per page without requiring pagination
3. WHEN space is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information and truncate less critical details
4. WHEN displaying goal events THEN the system SHALL utilize extra space to show more detailed scorer information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user switching between different terminal sizes, I want the UI to respond immediately to size changes, so that I don't need to restart the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal size changes THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 100ms
2. WHEN layout needs to be recalculated THEN the system SHALL update the display without flickering
3. WHEN pagination state becomes invalid due to size changes THEN the system SHALL adjust to a valid page automatically
4. WHEN auto-refresh occurs during a resize THEN the system SHALL maintain the new layout dimensions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the dynamic sizing to be configurable, so that I can fine-tune the behavior and add new responsive features easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing dynamic sizing THEN the system SHALL use configurable constants for minimum and maximum dimensions
2. WHEN calculating layout THEN the system SHALL use modular functions that can be easily tested and modified
3. WHEN adding new responsive behaviors THEN the system SHALL follow the existing architecture patterns
4. WHEN debugging layout issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate logging for dimension calculations
